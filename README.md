# BenchmarkJFX v1.0
by Ramon Victor

A simple to use benchmark for JavaFX 2.x and above.
Includes the famous Bubblemark benchmark by Alexey Gavrilov (2007) and much more!
Currently it contains the following benchmarks:
- Bitmap (Bubblemark)
- Vector (Bubblemark)
- ListView
- AreaChart

##How-To-Use: 
Start the application with the following argument: "javafx.animation.fullspeed=true" so the complete command should look like this: "java -Djavafx.animation.fullspeed=true benchmarkjfx-1.0.jar". This will deactivate vsync and the capped fps.
